## Summary
* With our findings, we have discovered that a majority of citibikers in the NYC area are males who are subscribers.
* Most of the rides take place on weekdays from 7am - 9am and from 5pm - 7pm. This suggest that a majority of our riders use the bikes to get to and from work.
* The bikes are least likely to be used on weekdays after midnight. 
* We also discovered that most of the trips are centered towards the heart of the city. 

## Conclusion
* To conclude, for NYC, citibikes are mostly used by male subscibers, to get to and from work, and who are located in the middle of the city. 
* Citibikes are popular in NYC, but can they be succesfull in Des Moines, Iowa? 
* A visualization that would be helpful would be to gather information on the population density of Des Moines and compare it to the demographic of the people in the city. 
* Another visualization that would be helpful would be to see how many people drive cars in Des Moines. If a majority of people drive to work in the heart of Des Moines, an idea like citibikes might not work in such a city.
